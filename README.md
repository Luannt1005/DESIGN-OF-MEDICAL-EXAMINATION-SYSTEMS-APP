Waiting in line for many hours makes the patient feel depressed and tired. Patients have to go early in order to get their first exam number, sometimes they can't even keep track of the clinic schedule or the doctor they want to examine. 
When sick, the patient's immune system becomes weaker, and the risk of cross-infection to other diseases is very high. In crowded public places with many potential pathogens, people need to limit contact to protect themselves as well as avoid spreading diseases to others, especially in the present time, when the Corona epidemic is happening.
In order to solve the increasing need for medical examination and treatment, while helping patients proactively choose medical examination time without spending much time waiting, can help shorten the time to register for medical examination. Therefore, we provide the application for medical examination and treatment through a mobile phone application with the connection of many hospitals in the city. Patients can choose which hospital they want to see according to their address or medical condition.
